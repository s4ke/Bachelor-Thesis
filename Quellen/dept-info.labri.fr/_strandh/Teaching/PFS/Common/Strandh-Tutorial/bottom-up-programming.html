<H1>Bottom-up programming</H1>

<H2>What is bottom-up programming</H2>

Bottom-up programming is the opposite of <A
HREF="top-down-programming.html">top-down programming</A>.  It refers
to a style of programming where an application is constructed starting
with existing primitives of the programming language, and constructing
gradually more and more complicated features, until the all of the
application has been written.<P>

<H2>Advantages of bottom-up programming</H2>

Bottom-up programming has several advantages over <A
HREF="top-down-programming.html"> top-down programming </A>.<P>

Testing is simplified since no <A HREF="http://dept-info.labri.fr/~strandh/Teaching/PFS/Common/Strandh-Tutorial/glossary.html"> stubs </A> are
needed.  While it might be necessary to write <A
HREF="http://dept-info.labri.fr/~strandh/Teaching/PFS/Common/Strandh-Tutorial/glossary.html">test functions</A>, these are simpler to write
than stubs, and sometimes not necessary at all, in particular if one
uses an interactive programming environment such as Common Lisp or
GDB.<P>

Pieces of programs written bottom-up tend to be more general, and thus
more reusable, than pieces of programs written top-down.  In fact, one
can argue that the purpose bottom-up programming is to create an <A
HREF="http://dept-info.labri.fr/~strandh/Teaching/PFS/Common/Strandh-Tutorial/building-specialized-languages.html"> application-specific
language </A>.  Such a language is suitable for implementing an entire
class of applications, not only the one that is to be written.  This
fact greatly simplifies maintenance, in particular adding new features
to the application.  It also makes it possible to delay the final
decision concerning the exact functionality of the application.  Being
able to delay this decision makes it less likely that the client has
changed his or her mind between the establishment of the
specifications of the application and its implementation.<P>

<H2>How does bottom-up programming work?</H2>

In a language such as C or Java, bottom-up programming takes the form
of constructing <A HREF="http://dept-info.labri.fr/~strandh/Teaching/PFS/Common/Strandh-Tutorial/abstract-data-types.html">abstract data
types</A> from primitives of the language or from existing abstract
data types.<P>

In Common Lisp, in addition to constructing abstract data types, it is
common to build <EM>functions</EM> bottom-up from simpler functions,
and to use macros to construct new <EM>special forms</EM> from simpler
ones.<P>

One may ask why it is not possible to construct functions and special
forms bottom-up in other languages than Common Lisp.  Constructing
functions bottom-up requires a way of passing complicated arguments
between functions.  Common Lisp uses <EM>lists</EM> for such argument
passing.  Lists are flexible standardized data structures in the
language.  In other languages, data structures would have to be
defined for such parameter passing only, making it more like an
abstract data type than just a function.  With respect to special
forms, only the <A HREF="http://dept-info.labri.fr/~strandh/Teaching/PFS/Common/Strandh-Tutorial/syntax.html"> two-level syntax </A> of Common
Lisp allows a flexible enough macro facility for bottom-up programming
of special forms.<P>
