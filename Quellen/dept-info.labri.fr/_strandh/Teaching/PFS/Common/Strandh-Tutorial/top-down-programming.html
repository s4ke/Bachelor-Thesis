<H1>Top-down programming</H1>

Top-down programming is the opposite of <A
HREF="bottom-up-programming.html">bottom-up programming</A>.  It refers
to a style of programming where an application is constructed starting
with a high-level description of what it is supposed to do, and
breaking the specification down into simpler and simpler pieces, until
a level has been reached that corresponds to the primitives of the
programming language to be used. <P>

<H2>Disadvantages of top-down programming</H2>

Top-down programming complicates testing.  Noting executable exists
until the very late in the development, so in order to test what has
been done so far, one must write <A HREF="http://dept-info.labri.fr/~strandh/Teaching/PFS/Common/Strandh-Tutorial/glossary.html"> stubs
</A>. <P>

Furthermore, top-down programming tends to generate modules that are
very specific to the application that is being written, thus not very
reusable. <P>

But the main disadvantage of top-down programming is that all
decisions made from the start of the project depend directly or
indirectly on the high-level specification of the application.  It is
a well-known fact that this specification tends to change over time.
When that happens, there is a great risk that large parts of the
application need to be rewritten.

<H2>How does top-down programming work?</H2>

Top-down programming tends to generate modules that are based on
functionality, usually in the form of functions or procedures.
Typically, the high-level specification of the system states
functionality.  This high-level description is then refined to be a
sequence or a loop of simpler functions or procedures, that are then
themselves refined, etc. <P>

In this style of programming, there is a great risk that
implementation details of many data structures have to be shared
between modules, and thus globally exposed.  This in turn makes it
tempting for other modules to use these implementation details,
thereby creating unwanted dependencies between different parts of the
application.
